# Personal User Guide: Ronny Karallus
I have recently been hit by a [newsletter](https://preview.mailerlite.com/t6v5w8w1d1/2003054563581498890/v5f7/) of one of my favorite websites [Collaborative Superpowers](https://www.collaborationsuperpowers.com/). It was describing how creating a personal user guide could help to clarify for yourself and other what you need to do your best work. Working with new people regularly in a hybrid setup, I thought this would be an excellent idea. So here you find mine.

## My Background

## Time Zone and working hours
Mostly, I am working from [Berlin, Germany](https://goo.gl/maps/KaqwKxjaXW8ErXvw9). The timezone there may be [CEST/CET](https://www.timeanddate.com/time/zone/germany/berlin-state).

My main priority is my family. I have a 4 year old son takes a lot of my attention, especially in the morning. 

I am working 32h per week for my employer [Mister Spex](https://www.misterspex.de/). Regular working hours are:

| Day       | 9   | 10  | 11  | 12  | 13  | 14  | 15  | 16  | 17  | 18  | 19  |
|-----------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| Monday    |  -  | MRX | MRX |  -  | MRX | MRX | MRX | MRX |  -  |  -  |  -  |
| Tuesday   | MRX | MRX | MRX |  -  | MRX | MRX | MRX | MRX |  -  |  -  |  -  |
| Wednesday | MRX | MRX | MRX |  -  | MRX | MRX | MRX | MRX |  -  |  -  |  -  |
| Thursday  | MRX | MRX | MRX |  -  | MRX | MRX | MRX | MRX |  -  |  -  |  -  |
| Friday    | MRX | MRX | MRX |  -  | MRX | MRX |  -  |  -  |  -  |  -  |  -  |

My second priority is my engagement as a freelancer for [GovMarket](https://www.govmarket.de/). I support this project for up to 8h per week.

## Languages
My mother tongue is **German**, even though that may be a discussion topic among german native speakers as I can have a pretty strong Saxonian accent.

You can also start a conversation with me in **English**. As I can follow movies, read most books, discuss about nearly everything and even sometimes think in this language, I consider my skills as advanced.

Even though I learned **French** for about 4 years in school, my skills are pretty rusty. You may be more successful approaching me in Klingon (which I did neither learn nor speak at any point).
